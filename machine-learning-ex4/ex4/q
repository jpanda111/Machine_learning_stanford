'randperm' is a built-in function from the file libinterp/corefcn/rand.cc

 -- randperm (N)
 -- randperm (N, M)
     Return a row vector containing a random permutation of '1:N'.

     If M is supplied, return M unique entries, sampled without
     replacement from '1:N'.

     The complexity is O(N) in memory and O(M) in time, unless M < N/5,
     in which case O(M) memory is used as well.  The randomization is
     performed using rand().  All permutations are equally likely.
